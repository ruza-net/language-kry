# kry

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to kry files in [Atom](http://atom.io/).

## Install

Install the package `language-kry` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager from a shell:

```bash
$ apm install language-kry
```

## Bugs

Grammar rules were written from scratch. They seem to work for most cases. However there are most certainly still a few cases that result in wrong syntax highlighting. Feel free to fix it and send a pull request, or open an issue to report it.

## Acknoledgement

This repository is based on [zargony's](https://github.com/zargony) [atom-language-rust](https://github.com/zargony/atom-language-rust).
